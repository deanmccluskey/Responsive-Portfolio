        <p>Welcome to my Portfolio Site! First, a little bit about me...</p>
        <h4>"WordSmith, Imagist and CodePro!!!"</h4>
        <p>I am a Software Developer (in training), who holds a Bachelor's degree in Journalism/ 
          Photojournalism from San Jose State University. Two weeks out of school, I was working 
          as a photographer for the Tahoe Daily Tribune! But I found the salary less than desirable, 
          so I returned to the hospitality industry which had put me through college.</p>
        <p>Years later, I returned to school to study Computer Science at Diablo Valley College. I took 
          courses from basic coding to advanced programming concepts using Assembly, C/C++, and Java/
          JavaScript. While I worked shortly in the technical field in the positions of Help Desk, 
          Customer Support and Software Quality Assurance, I never made the transition to Developer. 
          Since then, I have continued work as a waiter, a bartender, and even spent some time as a 
          casino dealer, learning <em>every</em> game in the house!!!</p>
        <p>But now the time has come for me to return to my passion! While I loved my photography, I love 
          coding more!!! I think the role of software developer, as that of a 21st century scribe, 
          connecting their clients to the masses. And the practice of development, especially app 
          functionality, is somewhat akin to a mental "Chinese puzzle" (something I loved as a kid)!</p>
        <p>So here I AM, part <em>poet</em>, part <em>artist</em>, and full-on <em><strong>technophile!
        </strong></em> And here is <a href="portfolio.html">my work</a>!!!</p>
